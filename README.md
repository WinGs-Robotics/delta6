## 🚀 Overview

**Delta6** is a **low-cost**, **lightweight**, and **easy-to-assemble** 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) flexible end-effector. Built upon an innovative modified Delta parallel mechanism, it integrates:

- **Six antagonistic spring units** for high-resolution force sensing.
- Real-time multi-axis force and displacement measurements.
- Built-in analytical compensation algorithms, correcting for imperfections from **3D-printed parts** and **commercial springs**.

Its inherent compliance makes Delta6 ideal for interactive tasks such as human–robot collaboration, precision assembly, and delicate manipulation.
